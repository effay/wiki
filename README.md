##### 4chan /fa/ Sticky Wiki Renewal Process

This repository is dedicated to improving the state of [**the Wiki**](http://tuxbell.com/index.php/Main_Page) for the
[**4chan /fa/shion board**](http://4chan.org/fa/catalog).

**Old Wiki Layout** - The old structure of the Wiki. What we have to work with. Pretty static.

**Planned Wiki Layout** - What we are planning on doing with the Wiki structure. Work in progress.

**Planned Effay Sticky** - What we are planning on doing with the /fa/ sticky itself. Not started yet.

**To Do List** - General list of things we have done, are doing, and will do. Work in progress.

How to get in touch with us:

*adrift*, *KeyCo*, or *STHLM*, in the improve-the-sticky threads on /fa/.
