**Format: Things in parentheses clarify our actions**

**We should consider adding user tags to this, in order to make it clear who-does-what.**

### Done
- Make a thread about improving the wiki. 
- Check our privilege on [tuxbell.com](https://tuxbell.com) (registered users can edit pages)
- See that the Tuxbell admin is active (he [Caleb] is and is willing to help)
- Map the current structure of the wiki
- Register github as a base of operations ([github.com/effay](https://http://github.com/effay))
- Start a designated IRC channel that /could/ be used for Wiki discussion (#effay @ rizon)
- Establish a method of direct communication (#/fa/ @ rizon)
- Design and upload a [project logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/effay/effay.github.io/master/effaylogo.png) for github 
- Decide upon if we want Github Markdown (like README.md) on all files on GitHub, for layout purposes. (use .md)
- Add all three current contributors to the Effay GitHub (*adrift, STHLM, KeyCo*)
- Make a prototype structure for the new Wiki

### In Progress
- Create a new thread in order to:
  - Brainstorm with the board in order to establish the most needed changes to the wiki
    - Agree on a final structure so we can start writing/revising/deleting
  - Ask for more contributors
- Resolve Keyco's tuxbell registration problem by emailing Tuxbell admin (awaiting response)
- Decide upon To Do List structure - should it be anti-chronological to keep us from scrolling?
- Register all three users on Rizon (Only KeyCo left)
- OP all of the three users on #effay (Once you've registered and set nickname enforce on)
- Decide on a new, custom CSS. Current favorite: [Wikipedia Minimalismo](https://userstyles.org/styles/100852/wikipedia-minimalismo)

### Planned tasks (Not started yet)
- Email the Tuxbell admin about
  - CSS change (include [CSS code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/effay/effay.github.io/master/tuxbell-minimalismo.css) + [example screenshot](http://a.1339.cf/cxojwj.png))
  - to what extent we are allowed to edit board guidelines/rules
  - the image thumbnail issue
  - legality/issues on replica information
  - [anything else?]
- Determine which sections in the wiki are extremely lacking
  - This is a section already created in the "OldWikiLayout"
  - 
- Condense the TuxBell sticky to create a "mini sticky" /fa/, the board itself (PlannedEffayWiki.md)

*The following is a list of random things that will be partially incorporated in the above to-do list.*

*It's a beta-version of a to-do list I (STHLM) wrote.*

*The following will be removed, in time.*

Creating regular improve-the-sticky threads with a clear list of what needs to be done, and a call for action among the board. Should manage to get people writing that way.
remove dadcore/mfa tier shit from the introduction

Get contributors for specific topics by starting general threads where we include information about what needs to be done in the sticky. 

The fact that we have recurring General threads should translate into the sticky.
Information that could be useful to people there should be featured in the sticky. 
- How to include topics related to Fuccboi general? ---> FAQ? Under introduction, or General style basics?
- Should we include Replicas in the sidebar? Ask admin for legal.
- Should info on tattoos be included? Too off-topic?
- How to incorporate W2C
- Modeling?
- Thinspo/losing weight?

How to make people add content:
We don't have to make them. We can add content for them.
It's much easier to get input from users by making threads about the topics, than asking people to edit the wiki themselves. People are more likely to write a response on /fa/. To expand the glossary, for example, we'll just make a thread sharing the current glossary list and asking people if they know any more terms that are currently used on /fa/ and what they mean.
