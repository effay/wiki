**Format: Things in parentheses clarify our actions**

**We should consider adding user tags to this, in order to make it clear who-does-what.**

### Done
- Make a thread about improving the wiki. 
- Check our privilege on [tuxbell.com](https://tuxbell.com) (registered users can edit pages)
- See that the Tuxbell admin is active (he [Caleb] is and is willing to help)
- Map the current structure of the wiki
- Register github as a base of operations ([github.com/effay](https://http://github.com/effay))
- Start a designated IRC channel that /could/ be used for Wiki discussion (#effay @ rizon)
- Design and upload a [project logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/effay/effay.github.io/master/effaylogo.png) for github 
- Decide upon if we want Github Markdown (like README.md) on all files on GitHub, for layout purposes. (use .md)
- Add all three current contributors to the Effay GitHub (*adrift, STHLM, KeyCo*)
- Make a prototype structure for the new Wiki
- Created a new thread in order to:
  - Brainstorm with the board in order to establish the most needed changes to the wiki
    - Agree on a final structure so we can start writing/revising/deleting (waiting for more responses in-thread)
  - Ask for more contributors (waiting for more responses in-thread)

### In Progress
- Resolve Keyco's tuxbell registration problem by emailing Tuxbell admin (awaiting response)
- Decide upon To Do List structure - should it be anti-chronological to keep us from scrolling?
- Decide on a new, custom CSS. Current favorite: [Wikipedia Minimalismo](https://userstyles.org/styles/100852/wikipedia-minimalismo)

### Planned tasks (Not started yet)
- Determine which sections in the wiki are extremely lacking
  - This is a section already created in the "OldWikiLayout"
- Condense the TuxBell sticky to create a "mini sticky" /fa/, the board itself (PlannedEffayWiki.md)
- A WAYWT archive
  - Collect pictures from WAYWT threads, along with other styles where fitpics are present such as palewave and techwear related threads
    - Can place them under each style as a subsection in the wiki
    - Or maybe "User Submitted Fits"
- Create a new logo for the wiki (and possibly the sticky)
  - [Current sidebar logo](http://a.1339.cf/beusba.png)
    - Unsure if this is the actual logo for TuxBell, if it exists at all
  - Make a thread about it, where users can submit pictures - and/or ask /gd/

*The following is a list of random things that will be partially incorporated in the above to-do list.*

*It's a beta-version of a to-do list I (STHLM) wrote.*

*The following will be removed, in time.*

Creating regular improve-the-sticky threads with a clear list of what needs to be done, and a call for action among the board. Should manage to get people writing that way.
remove dadcore/mfa tier shit from the introduction

Get contributors for specific topics by starting general threads where we include information about what needs to be done in the sticky. 

The fact that we have recurring General threads should translate into the sticky.
Information that could be useful to people there should be featured in the sticky. 
- How to include topics related to Fuccboi general? ---> FAQ? Under introduction, or General style basics?
- Should info on tattoos be included? Too off-topic?
- How to incorporate W2C
- Modeling?
- Thinspo/losing weight?
