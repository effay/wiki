**Format: Things in parentheses clarify our actions**

**INPR = In Progress; TBD = To Be Determined (as in: It's not time to do that yet)**

**We should consider adding user tags to this, in order to make it clear who-does-what.**

### Done
- Make a thread about improving the wiki. 
- Check our (editing) previlege on tuxbell.com (registered users can edit pages)
- See that the Tuxbell admin is active (he [Caleb] is and is willing to help)
- Map the current structure of the wiki
- Register github as a base of operations (github.com/effay)
- Start a designated IRC channel that /could/ be used for Wiki discussion (#effay @ rizon)
- Establish a method of direct communication (#/fa/ @ rizon)
- Design and upload a project logo for github 
- Decide upon if we want Github Markdown (like ReadMe.md) on all files on GitHub, for layout purposes. (use .md)
- Add all three current contributors to the Effay GitHub

### INPR
- Brainstorm with the board in order to establish the most needed changes to the wiki (still going)
- Make a prototype structure for the new Wiki
- Ask for more contributors in-thread (awaiting response)
- Resolve Keyco's tuxbell registration problem by emailing tuxbell admin (awaiting response)
- Decide upon To Do List structure - should it be anti-chronological to keep us from scrolling?

### TBD

*The following is a list of random things that will be partially incorporated in the above to-do list.*

*It's a beta-version of a to-do list I (STHLM) wrote.*

*The following will be removed, in time.*

Images aren't showing up in articles. This is crucial.
We need images to show up everywhere.

Creating regular improve-the-sticky threads with a clear list of what needs to be done, and a call for action among the board. Should manage to get people writing that way.
remove dadcore/mfa tier shit from the introduction

including info about 'fashion as art'

ask the admin about the rules/"posting guidelines". 

Get contributors for specific topics by starting general threads where we include information about what needs to be done in the sticky. 

The fact that we have recurring General threads should translate into the sticky.
Information that could be useful to people there should be featured in the sticky. 
- How to include topics related to Fuccboi general? ---> FAQ? Under introduction, or General style basics?
- Should we include Replicas in the sidebar? Ask admin for legal.
- Should info on tattoos be included? Too off-topic?
- How to incorporate W2C
- Modelling?
- Thinspo/losing weight?


Suggested method of operations:

Map the current sticky structure [done]

Map the planned sticky structure [in progress]

Compare the current and planned sticky structure, and merge them in order to give us an perspective on what the future sticky might look like.

Establish a consensus on what the sticky should, and should not, feature.

List the good and bad aspects of the current sticky, and see how this can be built upon for the future version.

See if there are anything in the current planned structure that should be removed/added.

How to make people add content:
We don't have to make them. We can add content for them.
It's much easier to get input from users by making threads about the topics, than asking people to edit the wiki themselves. People are more likely to write a response on /fa/. To expand the glossary, for example, we'll just make a thread sharing the current glossary list and asking people if they know any more terms that are currently used on /fa/ and what they mean.
